Please also check the Erratum to the Paper: [Sarbadhicary et al (2019)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019MNRAS.tmp.1400S/abstract) for corrections to some typographical errors in the paper.

The code is written with Python 2.7, although it should work with Python 3+. It should only require `numpy` and `matplotlib` installed.

### Installation
You can do the following :-
1. If you have [git](https://git-scm.com/) installed, you can directly clone this repository using `git clone https://github.com/sks67/s17lc.git` into your computer
2. Copy paste the `s17lc.py` into a blank `.py` file directly in your computer and use it accordingly.

### Description
The program `s17lc.py` is the coded up version of the equations A1-A11 in the paper. There are two main modules :-

1. `radius_velocity()`: This provides the radius and velocity of the supernova remnant for a given age, based on the dimensional variables and self similar solutions in [Truelove & Mckee 1999](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1999ApJS..120..299T). 

2. `luminosity()`: This provides the luminosity of the supernova remnant, given the radius, velocity, density and other parameters. 

### Usage
You can use these to create light curves or estimate values at a particular age. I have included a Jupyter notebook, `test_s17lc.ipynb` to show how to generate radius, velocity, and light curves with the code. 

### Miscellaneous Notes

The constants c1, c5, and c6 have a small dependence on the spectral index. I'll update this in the next iteration.
